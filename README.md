# Code-Refactoring

The goal of this project was to maintain functionality of the page while making the site more accessible to users relying screen readers to navigate a site.

In order to begin refactoring the original code for this project I needed to understand a few things first:
    1. The layout of the html and css code
    2. How to incorporate semantic html 
    3. The purpose of using semantic tags in code
    4. what is refactoring

I've made a series of commits showing portions of my process while refactoring.

Inside you'll find comments about changes and parts of my thought process along the way!
